# The-LinkBox-Project
UX Tool to remove distractions when you read articles

I'm easily distracted. 

When that Facebook notification popups up, I have to click on it :-p

When I read an interesting article packed with links to external 
resources — I feel like I have to open them in a new tab, because
maybe I'd forget if I just continue reading, and I don't want to 'miss out' (FOMO). 

This behavior greatly distract from the reading experience. 

The LinkBox Project is about building a UI / UX tool that will enhance the
URX — User Reading Experience — by making it possible to save links in articles
to a so-called LinkBox, that is located at the bottom of the article. 

Now every time you stumble over an interesting link, you can quickly save it
and know that you can check it out when you're done reading. 

To dos:
1. 
Use localStorage to make sure that the LinkBox doesn't go away
if the user accidentally close the tab / browser. 

2. 
Make a Save to TXT, Save to HTML, and Send to Email function, so the user can quickly 
save their links permanently. 


Written in jQuery — but I will rewrite it in Vanilla JavaScript to optimize performance (especially on animations).
